# AppTest

This app started its live as Pure React YT video browser
However it was refactored to show a redux flow.

When vote functionality was added it rely on Redux reducer 
When vote Yes or No, it will force to reload video queue based on randomly selected search term.
I had to do it without interference with already created search bar and selectable list.

```
> npm install
> npm start
```
